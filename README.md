# excel-clone

This project is based on basic implementation of excel or google sheets using HTML, CSS and JavaScript . In this project , I use the Graph theory i.e. indegree and outdegree of a node to implement formula , cycle detection algorithm to remove circular dependencies (working Phase)  and local storage to store the data of sheets .
